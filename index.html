        <h2>About this Website</h2>
        <p>Hey!</p>
        <p>
            Winter break finally came and I decided I'd use this time to pick up new skills and create things I typically wouldn't find myself doing. 
            I've had the idea of coding my own website for a while now but have pushed it aside for too long. I really wanted a platform where I could showcase 
            my projects in a more personalized manner and I figured this would be the best way to do that. I had fun learning a thing or two in the process. Enjoy!

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p> I'm a third-year student studying Mechanical Engineering at UCSD. </p>
            <p> I started my college career with an interest in Biology, which grew into Bioengineering, which grew into Mechanical Engineering. 
                I knew Engineering was the path for me after completing my first two undergraduate physics classes. Although these were the hardest 
                classes I had taken up to this point, I found the challenge incredibly rewarding. Not surprisingly I've always been interested in 
                solving puzzles and enjoy setting challenges for myself. Gaining technical experience from my extracurricular activities was 
                very important to me from the get-go and has allowed me to hone in on my professional pursuits. 
            </p>
            <p> Outside of school I really enjoy doing outdoor activities. 
                I'm very grateful to have spent this past Summer in Seattle WA as an intern. I spent most of my weekends hiking any 
                cool trail I could find, preferably ones with a waterfall or lake, and I even had the opportunity to backpack for the first time!
                I usually save my hikes for when I have more time on my hands, when I'm not doing that you can either find me rock-climbing or running. 
                Distance-running has been a hobby I've kept up with since high school. I completed my first half-marathon in May last year, and I definitely look forward to doing
                more in the future! Rock climbing is also another hobby I juggle, and although I am not the best climber, I find the
                sport to be so much fun.  
            </p>

            <h3>ROCKET PROPULSION LABORATORY</h3>
            <p> I joined Rocket Propulsion in October 2022 as part of their New Member Project (NMP).
                Engaging in NMP offered a hands-on initiation into rocket design, fostering collaboration and 
                practical engineering skills. Guided by experienced mentors, I gained proficiency in CAD development and simulation 
                setup using tools like OpenRocket and SOLIDWORKS. The program's inclusive atmosphere encouraged creativity, 
                leading to the exciting launch of G-class model rockets at the Friends of Amateur Rocketry in CA, and 
                solidifying my foundational knowledge and passion for rocketry. 
            <p>
            < src="NMPTeam.jpg" style="width: 100%; max-width: 500px; height: auto;">
            <p> More excitingly, after NMP I joined the Osiris Structures team. Osiris is RPL's new and first multi-stage solid propellant rocket, meant to compete in the 2025 Spaceport
                America Cup, an intercollegiate rocket engineering competition. As part of the structres team I've conducted 
                quantitative analysis of materials and geometric designs for Osiris's external structure with simulations. 
                At our current pace we hope to finalize our design by the end of this year and with some in-house fiberglass layups. 
                As the safety officer of my team, I maintain a comprehensive understanding of our design's manufacturing methods
                and am knowledgable about safety protocols.
            <p>
            <p> Being a part of RPL has been incredibly rewarding. I consistently find myself facing new challenges that push me 
                to learn concepts beyond my current skillset. What makes Osiris particularly meaningful to me is its embodiment 
                of our shared ambition to soar to new heights, both literally and metaphorically. Osiris is my most long-term project 
                I've committed to thus far, and I am eagerly looking forward to its launch date.
            <p>
